Currently SK includes these built-in libraries

### The ```math``` library

```rs

Includes many simple mathematical functions such as:

* ```math.sqrt()```, returns the sqrt of the argument
* ```math.PI```, Pi constant
* ```math.E```, Euler's constant

* ```math.sin()```
* ```math.cos()```
* ```math.tan()```

* ```math.abs()```, absolute value
* ```math.min()```, highest value of the given args
* ```math.max()```, lowest value of the given args

* ```math.log()```
* ```math.ln()```

* ```math.atan2()```

* ```math.deg()```, from rads to degrees
* ```math.rad()```, from degrees to radians

> More will be possibly added in the future

### TODO:

* ```os```
* ```files```
* ```rand```
* ```server*```

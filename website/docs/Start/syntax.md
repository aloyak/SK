# Syntax

## SK Language Syntax

SK has a very Rust-inspired Syntax with the only major difference being the lack of the semicolon to mark the end of an action, this is why the following code is not allowed in SK:

```rs
write("Hello,") write("World!") // NOT ALLOWED!
```

### Comments

```rs
// Basic in-Line Comments using '//'

/*
    Multi-line comments
    by using these brakets!
*/
```

For all the rest of the syntax please continue reading the documentation (sorry!, it is a short read tho)

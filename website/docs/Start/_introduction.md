# Introduction

## Welcome to the SK Programming Language Documentation.

SK is a high-level interpreted programming language designed to handle incomplete, approximate, or partially known information as first-class entities. Unlike traditional languages, SK does not assume all variables have exact values. Instead, it tracks uncertainty explicitly throughout calculations, decisions, and control flow.

The language is designed for safer, more honest, and analyzable computation in contexts where data may be noisy, incomplete, or evolving.

### The Interpreter

As already mentioned, SK is an interpreted language. In order to make SK fast and safe to use, the interpreter was made entirely in rust.
